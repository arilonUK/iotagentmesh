# IoT Agent Mesh

A modern web-based platform for managing IoT device agents, built using React, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript.

## API Gateway

Authenticated organization-scoped `/api/data` requests are proxied to an `api-data` edge function with an `x-organization-id` header for secure access to device readings and data buckets. These calls require a bearer token and membership in the target organization.
Unit tests verify that both device-reading and bucket-data paths are forwarded with the correct method, path, body, and organization header.

## üåê Project Overview
This project provides a UI and backend system for users to:
- Register and manage organisations and users
- Add and configure IoT agents
- View telemetry and device status
- Configure alerts, automations, and integrations
- Forward organisation-scoped `/api/data` requests to an edge function for data access

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, RLS, Edge Functions)
- **Tooling**: ESLint, Vitest, Prettier

## üöÄ Quickstart
```bash
# 1. Clone the repo
$ git clone https://github.com/arilonUK/iotagentmesh.git
$ cd iotagentmesh

# 2. Run setup script (installs dependencies and verifies environment)
$ ./scripts/setup.sh

# 3. Copy and configure environment variables
